ConsoleApplication1
===================


This program will take input from a sensor, control a motor and read the 
value of a door latch. The state machine will need to first calibrate the 
sensor, read data, and move the motor to a position that is the average 
of the data received, unless the door is open.

This application is written in C++ under windows 8.1 using Visual Studio 2012 
pro as code editor and compiler. To ensure that the application runs, please 
create a C++ project in Visual Studio 2012 or 2013 and add .h files to Header
Files and add .cpp files to Source Files. Once the file are all included,
press F5. If the application does not run properly, please contact me.

Thank you for your time.
